  <h1>With A Chance</h1>      
  <p>Using the BFR to get excess food where it's needed.</p>           
  <p>The BFR can get a payload from one hemisphere of the world to the other within less than an hour. While this is an impressive technology for transportation and commerce, it also fills a large gap -- transporation of excess food in a non-problematic timeframe. While unbelievable, 40% of food produced in the USA is discarded as waste. Most of that food has historically not been recovered.</p>

  <p>Through partnerships with over 1000 restaurants, catering organizations, and verified households, at the end of each day excess food gets sent to towns of need with same-day delivery. The large restaurants pay a small fee to participate in the program - this promotes true value in investing toward the cause. Family restaurants, farms, and households get rewards for participating - this incentivizes individual action. Governments or institutions receive the food at a immensely discounted price based on their need - this maintains the integrity of the market. Money is funneled back into R&D for research in getting the food there as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>
  All food is assured for overall quality, and the donation of food by the USA is protected by their Good Samaritan Act. Food that is not calorie- and nutrient-efficient per kilogram of payload is send to local food banks. While we have a volunteer program, the model is designed to perform effectively beyond the need for free work.</p>

  <p>We also create minimal offices equipped with automation - lightweight yet secure packages that allow us to quickly set up shop in places of need. Gradually, the offices are expanded to include freezers. Then, the clean energy offices can be recollapsed for use in another location. We distribute reusable plates and cutlery that are customized to each owner's name. Every delivery is labeled with the donor's information if wanted - displayed on the central office and mobile phone of the recipients.</p>

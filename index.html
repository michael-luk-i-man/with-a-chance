  <h1>With A Chance</h1>      
  <p>Using the BFR to get excess food where it's needed.</p>           
  <p>The BFR can get a payload from one hemisphere of the world to the other within less than an hour. While this is an impressive technology for transportation and commerce, it also fills a large gap -- transporation of excess food in a non-problematic timeframe. While unbelievable, 40% of food produced in the USA is discarded as waste. Most of that food has historically not been recovered.</p>

  <p>Through partnerships with over 1000 restaurants, catering organizations, and verified households, at the end of each day excess food gets sent to towns of need with same-day delivery. The large restaurants pay a small fee to participate in the program - this promotes true value in investing toward the cause. Family restaurants and households get rewards for participating - this incentivizes individual action. Governments or institutions receive the food at a immensely discounted price based on their need - this maintains the integrity of the market. Money is funneled back into R&D for research in getting the food there as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>
  All food is assured for overall quality, and the donation of food by the USA is protected by their Goo own profits.d Samaritan Act. Food that is not calorie- and nutrient-efficient per kilogram of payload is send to local food banks. While we have a volunteer program, the model is designed to perform abundantly beyond the need for free work.</p>
